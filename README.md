# SDL_Tutorial
Followed a yt tutorial by ArchieG

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.
SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings available for several other languages, including C# and Python.

This little project uses C++ to create a window, plot a little square on it, and move it around through processing keystroke events.
